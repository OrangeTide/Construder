obj:Stones:lore
Stones are probably the most basic material found in the Construct.
They were collected by the nano bot probes from asteroids and planets
of the starsystem Anthymarsio. It proved to be a good foundation for
the Construct but eventually it was processed into further materials.

obj:Iron:lore
Probably the most useful metal found in the Construct. It's used in a wide
range of other materials and also any techical device can't but built without
at least on part that has some iron in it.
