:obj:Stones:lore
Stones are probably the most basic material found in the Construct.
They were collected by the nano bot probes from asteroids and planets
of the starsystem Anthymarsio. It proved to be a good foundation for
the Construct but eventually it was processed into further materials.
.
:obj:Iron:lore
Probably the most useful metal found in the Construct. It's used in a wide
range of other materials and also any techical device can't but built without
at least on part that has some iron in it.
.
:obj:Pattern Storage:lore
The Pattern Storage can hold the matter and energy patterns of materials. Your
inventory is designed after this. You can use this as external storage for
gathered materials that don't fit into your inventory. Even though your inventory
can not hold an arbitrary number of complex materials, it can hold multiple
Pattern Storages.

:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
A Vaporizer vaporizes materials in a certain Radius around it. It's much faster
than dematerialization, as the atom bondings are dissolved in a destructive
way. You use it by building it in a place you want to vaporize blocks,
and apply it after it is built.
However, as destructive they are to their environment, they will not harm the
user in any way.
There are multiple types of Vaporizers with different characteristics.
.
:obj:Vaporizer A:lore
The basic and simplest type is the Vaporizer A, which destructs in a radius of
1 blocks around it (which are all 8 blocks).
.
:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
The type B destructs in a radius of 2.
.
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
The type C vaporizes in a radius of 4 blocks. But it's slightly unreliable
due to the higher energy output, which means that it sometimes does not work.
.
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
Type D vaporizers are the most destructive ones, they can vaporize blocks in
a radius up to 10 around them. But they are so unreliable, that their radius
can vary a lot.
.
:obj:VapoModule:lore
This is a base module, used for building vaporizers.
