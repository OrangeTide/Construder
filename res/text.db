obj:Stones:lore
Stones are probably the most basic material found in the Construct.
They were collected by the nano bot probes from asteroids and planets
of the starsystem Anthymarsio. It proved to be a good foundation for
the Construct but eventually it was processed into further materials.

obj:Iron:lore
Probably the most useful metal found in the Construct. It's used in a wide
range of other materials and also any techical device can't but built without
at least on part that has some iron in it.

obj:Pattern Storage:lore
The Pattern Storage can hold the matter and energy patterns of materials. Your
inventory is designed after this. You can use this as external storage for
gathered materials that don't fit into your inventory. Even though your inventory
can not hold an arbitrary number of complex materials, it can hold multiple
Pattern Storages.
