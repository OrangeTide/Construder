Revision history for Games::Construder

0.94
        - Added feedback for eating bio energy stuff. A small little box is
          now displayed right next to the bio energy now.
        - I had it with Module::Install, so I switched back to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
          The problem was the outdated META.json generation (non existing one
          maybe fits more. And with File::ShareDir::Install any reason for me
          for Module::Install just vanished into thin air. Now I can also specify
          the C build flags much more straight forward.
